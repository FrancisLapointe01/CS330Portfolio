How do I approach designing software?
For me I design software with the intention of gaining new skills and experiences, in this project I used OpenGL for the first time and I aimed very ambitiously towards a goal of recreating a scene in a few weeks that I didn't achieve in full but feel very happy with what I was able to accomplish during that time as it means I have a lot of room to grow in experience.

How do I approach developing programs?
For me I start with an end goal of what I want to make, from there i break it up into little miniture steps and plan day by day what I intend on doing with a set end date in mind. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
For me I don't know how often I would end up using the skillset I gained during this class as I mostly want to enter into software engineering however if the opportunity were to arise I would absolutely take another chance to utilize OpenGL and create something similar.
